Introduction ,"Pediatric melanoma is defined as a malignant melanocytic lesion in a child from birth to age of 18 or 21 years, depending on the cutoff employed for defining adulthood. Pediatric melanoma can be further subclassified according to the specific age range at presentation (congenital, infantile, prepubertal childhood versus postpubertal adolescence), histologic subtype, presence or absence of precursor
lesions, and by using the standard clinical and pathologic staging criteria applied to adult cases. A major issue in any discussion of pediatric melanoma is the difficulty frequently encountered in establishing whether or not a histologically abnormal melanocytic lesion is in fact unequivocally malignant. While some of the difficulty may stem from a relative hesitancy to diagnose melanoma in young children, there
are clearly a number of abnormal melanocytic lesions that are difficult or impossible  to reliably categorize as benign or malignant using currently available histopathologic criteria.

","Diffuse leptomeningeal melanocytosis is a rare tumor of meninges arising from leptomeningeal melanocytes, characterized by diffuse infiltration of the leptomeninges (pia mater and arachnoidea) anywhere in the central nervous system. Clinical features may include stillbirth, intracranial hypertension and hydrocephalus, seizure, ataxia, syringomyelia, cranial nerve palsy, intracranial haemorrhage, sphincter dysfunction and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Transformation into malignant melanoma of the central nervous system was reported. It may be associated with congenital nevi, as a part of neurocutaneous melanosis.

Treatment ,"Melanoma in children is a very rare disease with many different subtypes. However, different treatment options have been developed in order to increase the prognosis and have a better outcome. In general lines, surgical resection of the tumor (if possible) is the primary line treatment. Other possibilities such as radiotherapy or chemotherapy can be given depending on the patient's stage, type and location, among others.","The diffuse leptomeningeal melanocytosis is an aggressive disease with very few treatment options. This is due to the impossibility of surgical resection for diffuse leptomeningeal involvement. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy have been stablished as the standard treatment; however, no apparent benefit has been reported. This is why current treatment is essentially palliative, consisting on tumor debulking and the placement of a ventricular shunt to prevent or relieve intracranial hypertension. ",Long-term screening of individuals at high risk and monitoring in familial melanoma families is recommended. This involves a total-body skin examination by a qualified dermatologist every six months. Self-examination of skin should be encouraged. Treatment is similar to sporadic melanoma and is largely based on surgery at initial stages and molecular therapy in metastatic stages.,"There are different types of treatments available for patients with intraocular melanoma. Some are standard (that are currently used) and some are being tested in clinical trials (research studies to try to improve the current treatment). Five types of standard treatment are currently used:
-        Surgery is the most common treatment for uveal melanoma and depending on the size of the tumor different operations can be done. 
-        Watchful waiting consists on closely monitoring a patient’s condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear. This can be used for patients that are asymptomatic and have a stable tumor that is not growing. 
-        Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to eliminate cancer cells or to keep them from growing. There are different ways that the radiations is given depending on the type and the stage of the cancer being treated. 
-        Photocoagulation (also known as light coagulation) is a procedure that uses laser light to destroy blood vessels that bring nutrients to the tumor, causing the tumor cells to die. It is mostly used to treat small tumors. 
-        Thermotherapy is the use of heat from a laser to destroy cancer cells and shrink the tumor. 
An effective treatment for metastasis uveal melanoma has not been found, this is why for some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. They are done to find out if new treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.

Causes,"There have been several factors associated with an increase in the frequency of the disease. Nonetheless, each type of melanoma has its specific risk factors. In general terms, a person with fair skin with less pigment associated with blond or red hair and light colored eyes and freckles is more likely to have the disease. But melanoma can also develop in people with darker complexions. In addition, a history of repeatedly severe sunburns, excessive ultraviolet light exposure, having more than 100 moles, living closer to the equator and a family history of melanoma are also associated with an increased risk of skin cancer.","It is believed that the disease is caused from an abnormal proliferation of the melanocytes of the neural crest in the central nervous system in the prenatal age. However, the pathogenic mechanism is still unclear","Familial melanoma is a genetic or inherited condition. This means that the risk of melanoma can be passed from generation to generation in a family. To date, 2 genes have been primarily linked to familial melanoma; they are called CDKN2A and CDK4. A mutation (alteration) in one of these genes gives a person an increased risk of melanoma. Both CDKN2A and CDK4 play important roles in controlling when cells divide. Studies of families with mutations in CDKN2A from Europe, North America, and Australia have shown that the risk of melanoma varies by geographic area. The reasons for these differences are not fully understood. There may be differences in the amount of sun they receive, other individual or genetic differences, or a combination of these factors.","
The risk of uveal melanoma can be increased by different factors, such as having a light eye color, the presence of a cutaneous nevi, not being able to tan and a fair skin color (with freckles and that burns easily), among others. However, having any of these factors does not mean that the patient will get cancer, they only increase the risk of having the disease. On the other hand, not having any risk factors does not imply that there is no chance of getting uveal melanoma.

Epidemiology,"Pediatric melanoma accounts for 1–4 % of all cases of melanoma and 1–3 % of all
pediatric malignancies. It is the most common primary malignant tumor of the
skin in patients younger than 20 years of age. Though the incidence of melanoma in
children younger than 10 years has remained stable, the incidence of adolescent
melanoma is increasing at a rate of 2.9 % per year in the USA over the past 3
decades, with similar trends reflected throughout the world.
There were estimated to be 450 new cases of melanoma diagnosed in children
younger than 21 years in the USA in 2014. There is a slight female predominance,
and the increase in incidence of melanoma is highest in female adolescents.
While Caucasian children account for the majority of new diagnoses, the
incidence continues to rise in the Hispanic and Native American populations. // MELANOMA - Howard L. Kaufman

",Leptomeningeal melanoma is a rare and aggressive tumor in children. The mean age at diagnosis is around 5 years-old. ,"In the central nervous system (CNS), melanocytes normally exist in the leptomeninges located on the inferior surface of the cerebrum and, the anterolateral surface of the brainstem and the spinal cord. Melanocytosis and melanomatosis are benign and involve diffusely leptomeninges and superficial brain parenchyma, which generally occur in the setting of dermatologic syndrome8). Melanocytoma is a solitary, benign and low-grade tumor that occurs mostly in the intradural extramedullary cervical or thoracic spine5). Secondary or metastatic intracranial malignant melanoma is frequent in patients with disseminated melanomas. However, primary intracranial leptomeningeal melanomatosis, also known as a meningeal variant of primary intracranial malignant melanoma, is rare. Its rarity may contribute to the high chance of misdiagnosis, especially in the cases without skin lesions.

","Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults, representing 3%–5% of all melanomas. UM most commonly arises from choroidal melanocytes (85%–90%), but can also arise from the iris (3%–5%) and ciliary body (5%–8%).The median age of diagnosis is approximately 62 years; however, the peak range for diagnosis is between 70 and 79 years.

UM incidence varies by sex, race, and country. Males have a 30% greater incidence than females. In the US, the incidence is approximately five per million individuals, with a significantly higher incidence in non-Hispanic whites (6.02 per million) when compared with blacks and Asians (0.31 and 0.39 per million, respectively). Incidence in Hispanics is in the middle, at 1.67 per million. In Europe, incidence increases with latitude, ranging from two per million in Spain and Italy, four to six per million in Central Europe, and greater than eight per million in Denmark and Norway. The incidence in South Korea is similar to Asians in the US, at 0.42 per million. Source: NCBI"
Genetic ,"The majority of meanoma cases are sporadic, which means that they occur in people with no apparent history of the disorder in their family. However, there are several subtypes that can be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase the risk of developing the disease. When melanoma occurs as part of a genetic syndrome, the risk of melanoma follows the inheritance pattern of the syndrome.","Only sporadic cases of leptomeningeal melanocytosis have been reported to date, so the disease is not hereditary. ","Normally, every cell has 2 copies of each gene: 1 inherited from the mother and 1 inherited from the father. Familial melanoma susceptibility follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, in which case a mutation happens in only 1 copy of the gene. This means that a parent with a gene mutation may pass along a copy of his or her normal gene or a copy of the gene with the mutation. Therefore, a child who has a parent with a mutation has a 50% chance of inheriting that mutation. A brother, sister, or parent of a person who has a mutation also has a 50% chance of having the same mutation.
Options exist for people interested in having a child when a prospective parent carries a gene mutation that increases the risk for this hereditary cancer syndrome. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is a medical procedure done in conjunction with in-vitro fertilization (IVF). It allows people who carry a specific known genetic mutation to reduce the likelihood that their children will inherit the condition. A woman’s eggs are removed and fertilized in a laboratory. When the embryos reach a certain size, 1 cell is removed and is tested for the hereditary condition in question. The parents can then choose to transfer embryos which do not have the mutation. PGD has been in use for over 2 decades, and it has been used for several hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes. However, this is a complex procedure with financial, physical, and emotional factors to consider before starting.
","Even though there have been described different uveal melanoma in consanguine families, the majority of cases are sporadic, which means that there is no family history. However, there exist two rare cases where a genetic predisposition has been demonstrated: familial uveal melanoma that has an autosomal dominant inheritance and there are many generations affected and the uveal melanoma in young patients that represents the 1% of all uveal tumors and it can be associated with oculodermal melanocytosis or atypical skin moles.
